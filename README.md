# Getting Started

The goal of this repo is to help you get started at Code for DC, no matter what your goal is.

If you're new to coding or need a refresher, you'll find helpful resources in `learning` to get up and running.

If you'd like to bring a project to Code for DC, you'll find Code for DC's guidelines and lists of helpful tools in `working`.

There are also lots of terms out there, so we're collecting brief introductions in `what-is`.

This is a group effort! If you have information to add, let us know by opening an issue or submitting a pull request.
