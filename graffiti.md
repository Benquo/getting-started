This is a free-for-all text file. The *.md file extension means that it's a Markdown file. Markdown is a popular format for text editing, as it has very simple formatting options. You can learn more about it [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).

Markdown lets you use the extra formatting tools, but it also behaves exactly like a *.txt file in that you can just write stuff in it if that's what you feel like doing.
