# Starting a Project at Code for DC :fireworks:

## Make a Github Repo

For all Code for DC projects, a Github repo serves as the public backbone of the project. If you're not familiar with it, Github provides convenient version control using `git`, which permits multiple people to work on a project at the same time. Additionally, it lets you track issues and have discussions about the project. If you'd like to set up the repo for your project within Code for DC's Github organization, just let us know.

Even if your project is just in the brainstorming stage, or doesn't have much/any code, a Github repo is useful for several reasons. First, it provides a public face for your project, allowing others to find and interact with it. It may be useful to use a hackpad, emails, or brainstorming sessions to flesh out the project, but a repo's issue-tracking features can help accelerate this process. Second, it saves the idea and the space, preventing duplicative work. Third, it is a location to put your `civic.json` file, as discussed below.

## Create a `civic.json` file

A `civic.json` file is a means to share metadata about your project with the rest of the community. These files help to power Code for DC's projects page, and connect people with projects. The standard's specifications can be found [here](https://github.com/BetaNYC/civic.json/blob/master/specification.md). A template file for Code for DC projects can be found [here](civic.json.template).

## Tell everybody!

People want to help you! Bring your project to a Code for DC meeting, tweet to @CodeforDC about it, or send a message to the listserv.
